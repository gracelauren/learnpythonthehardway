#In Terminal where you normally run python to run your scripts, type pydoc raw_input. Read what it says. If you're on Windows try python -m pydoc raw_input instead.
#Get out of pydoc by typing q to quit.
#Look online for what the pydoc command does.
#Use pydoc to also read about open, file, os, and sys. It's alright if you do not understand those; just read through and take notes about interesting things.
